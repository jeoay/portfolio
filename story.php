                <h3 class="sub-headline">Professional</h3>
                <p class="content">I have been a UX Designer and Front-End Developer for over 3 years. I started out working as an intern at Aerojet Rocketdyne. I had the privilege to work with some great and talented people. I will always be appreciative toward my boss for giving me a chance and helping me become a professional. I was hired full-time at Aerojet once I graduated with a Digital Media Design bachelors degree from National University. I have since moved on to become a UX contractor but I am always interested in every opportunity.</p> 
                        
                <h3 class="sub-headline">Personal</h3>
                <p>I am currently living in the Sacramento area with my loving fiance and our two beautiful dogs. I love to have a good time when not being a UXer. I play on three recreational sports teams (baseball, softball and ice hockey) throughout the year. I am a huge sports fan. I grew up in San Jose so I love those bay area teams. Iâ€™m a huge fan of the Giants, Sharks, Raiders and since I have lived in Sacramento for over 15 years, the Sacramento Kings. Another hobby of mine is playing video games. Since I was boy I have been a huge gamer. Some of my all time favorite video games are Super Mario 64, MLB The Show,  Madden, The Elder Scrolls Series, and Tecmo Bowl. </p>
